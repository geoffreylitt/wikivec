The goal here is to create a bot that can automatically [wikirace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikirace), using nothing but local knowledge of word meanings based on word embeddings.

# Todos (in rough priority)

- [ ] use NMatrix to make it faster (will speed up iteration)
- [ ] consider a less greedy algorithm (it doesn't have the ability to get farther from target word in an intelligent way)
- [x] avoid cycles
- [ ] consider supporting n-grams
- [ ] build a web UI that shows images
